## Overview

First Frontend Mentor project. Basic QR code card by Jayson Bull.

### Screenshot

## My process

Basic HTML write-up of the pages contents and then began CSS styling. First step was colors and fonts followed by flex-box grid layout.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flex-box
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Practicing flex-box and CSS grids is always a good thing. Becoming more familiar with both and it's making my coding life a lot easier.

### Continued development

As eluded to above I would like to continue to work on my knowledge of flex-box and CSS grids. Also sometimes I have some trouble with the initial first step when beginning a project or starting to write CSS so projects like this that help navigate me early on are a good help.
